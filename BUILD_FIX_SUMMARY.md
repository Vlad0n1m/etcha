# Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was failing to build on Vercel with the following errors:
1. **Prisma Client Error**: Could not locate Query Engine library
2. **Environment Variable Error**: `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` was required during build time, causing build failures

## Root Cause
Service classes (`SolanaService`, `CollectionService`, `CandyMachineService`) were being instantiated at **module level** in API route files. This caused them to execute during the **build phase** when environment variables like `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` were not available.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Lazy Service Initialization
**Changed**: Module-level service instantiation to lazy initialization within route handlers.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/solana/candy-machine/[collectionId]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/solana/tickets/validate/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/solana/tickets/user/[wallet]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/solana/tickets/mint/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/solana/collections/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/solana/collections/[id]/route.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
const solanaService = new SolanaService(); // ❌ Runs at build time
const collectionService = new CollectionService();
const candyMachineService = new CandyMachineService(solanaService, collectionService);

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
    // Use services...
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Lazy initialization to avoid instantiation during build time
function getServices() {
    const solanaService = new SolanaService();
    const collectionService = new CollectionService();
    const candyMachineService = new CandyMachineService(solanaService, collectionService);
    return { solanaService, collectionService, candyMachineService };
}

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
    const { solanaService, collectionService, candyMachineService } = getServices(); // ✅ Runs at request time
    // Use services...
}
```

### 2. Prisma Configuration Updates

**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added binary targets for Vercel compatibility:
```prisma
generator client {
    provider      = "prisma-client-js"
    output        = "../src/generated/prisma"
    binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]  // Added for Vercel
}
```

**Deleted**: `prisma.config.ts`
- This deprecated file was requiring `DATABASE_URL` during build time
- All necessary configuration is already in `schema.prisma`
- Prisma warns this file will be removed in v7

### 3. Package.json Scripts

**File**: `package.json`

Updated build scripts to ensure Prisma client generation:
```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "build": "prisma generate && next build",  // Added prisma generate
    "start": "next start",
    "postinstall": "prisma generate",  // Added for automatic generation
    "db:seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"  // Moved from deprecated prisma config
}
```

### 4. Vercel Configuration

**Created**: `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "functions": {
    "src/app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 60
    }
  },
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

**Created**: `.vercelignore`

```
# Don't ignore generated Prisma client
!src/generated/prisma

# Ignore development files
node_modules
.git
.env
.env.local
*.log
coverage
.next/cache
```

### 5. Documentation

**Created**: `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Complete deployment guide
- Environment variable setup instructions
- Troubleshooting tips
- Post-deployment steps

## Verification

✅ **Local Build Test**: Successfully completed
```bash
npm run build
# Exit code: 0 - SUCCESS
```

## Required Environment Variables for Vercel

Set these in Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"

# Solana
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY="[1,2,3,...]"
SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.devnet.solana.com"
SOLANA_NETWORK="devnet"

# JWT
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://your-domain.vercel.app"
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Fixed module-level service instantiation
- [x] Updated Prisma configuration for serverless
- [x] Added build scripts for Prisma generation
- [x] Created Vercel configuration files
- [x] Verified local build succeeds
- [ ] Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Initialize marketplace (POST /api/marketplace/init)

## Expected Build Output

When deploying to Vercel, you should see:
1. ✅ Dependencies installation
2. ✅ Prisma client generation (via postinstall)
3. ✅ Next.js build completion
4. ✅ Static page generation
5. ✅ Deployment success

## Key Changes Summary

| Issue | Solution | Files Affected |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Services instantiated at module level | Lazy initialization via `getServices()` function | 6 API route files |
| Prisma binary not found on Vercel | Added `binaryTargets` in schema | `prisma/schema.prisma` |
| Prisma config requiring DATABASE_URL at build | Deleted deprecated `prisma.config.ts` | `prisma.config.ts` (deleted) |
| Prisma not generated before build | Added `postinstall` script | `package.json` |
| Missing Vercel configuration | Created Vercel config files | `vercel.json`, `.vercelignore` |

## Notes

- The warnings about `pino-pretty` and `bigint` are **not critical** and won't prevent deployment
- Services are now instantiated only when API routes are actually called
- Environment variables are only checked at **runtime**, not during **build time**
- Prisma client is automatically generated during `npm install` via postinstall hook

## Next Steps

1. **Commit all changes** to your repository
2. **Push to GitHub/GitLab**
3. **Configure environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Deploy** via Vercel dashboard or CLI
5. **Run migrations** after deployment: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
6. **Initialize marketplace**: Make POST request to `/api/marketplace/init`

---

**Status**: ✅ Build issues resolved - Ready for deployment
