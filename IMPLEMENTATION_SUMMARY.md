# Payment and Marketplace Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented real SOL payments for ticket purchases where organizers receive payments directly, platform gets 2.5% royalty, and fixed resale marketplace errors. All transactions now require user wallet signatures, ensuring proper payment flow on Solana blockchain.

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Candy Machine Refactor (Organizer Payment Destination)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/solana/CandyMachineService.ts`
- `src/lib/solana/CollectionService.ts`
- `src/lib/solana/adapters.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Candy Machine now accepts `organizerPublicKey` parameter
- ‚úÖ Payment destination set to organizer's wallet via `solPayment` guard
- ‚úÖ Platform wallet remains in `creators` array for 2.5% royalty enforcement
- ‚úÖ Added `eventCreatorWallet` field to `SolanaCollection` interface
- ‚úÖ CollectionService now fetches organizer's wallet address from User model

**Result:**
- **Primary Sales:** Organizer receives 100% of ticket price (minus gas fees)
- **Royalties:** Platform automatically receives 2.5% on all secondary market sales
- **Resale:** No additional fees for organizers, only 2.5% platform fee

### 2. Primary Sales Flow (Real SOL Payments)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/events/[id]/prepare-purchase/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/events/[id]/confirm-purchase/route.ts`
- `src/app/event/[id]/page.tsx` (already had prepare/confirm flow)

**Files Deleted:**
- `src/app/api/events/[id]/purchase/route.ts` (old backend minting removed)

**Flow:**
1. **Prepare:** Backend creates mint transaction with proper guards
2. **Sign:** User signs transaction with their wallet (real payment)
3. **Send:** Transaction sent to Solana blockchain
4. **Confirm:** Backend verifies transaction and updates database

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Real SOL payments from buyer to organizer
- ‚úÖ Platform 2.5% royalty enforced on-chain
- ‚úÖ Candy Machine created once and reused
- ‚úÖ Transaction signatures returned to user

### 3. Candy Machine Persistence

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/events/[id]/prepare-purchase/route.ts`
- `src/lib/solana/CandyMachineService.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Candy Machine created lazily on first purchase (if not exists)
- ‚úÖ Address saved to database after creation
- ‚úÖ Subsequent purchases reuse existing Candy Machine
- ‚úÖ Smart item loading: only loads items as needed

**Result:**
- Candy Machine creates **once per event**
- No unnecessary recreation
- Proper address persistence in database

### 4. Resale Marketplace Fix

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/api/marketplace/prepare-buy/route.ts` (new)
- `src/app/api/marketplace/confirm-buy/route.ts` (new)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/marketplace/buy/route.ts` (deprecated, returns 410)
- `src/app/resale/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/solana/MarketplaceService.ts`

**Fixed Issues:**
- ‚ùå **OLD:** "Assertion failed" error due to missing NFT asset in listing
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** NFT metadata loaded before creating listing
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Asset manually attached to listing if missing
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Buyer signs transaction on frontend (not backend)

**Flow:**
1. **Prepare:** Backend builds purchase transaction with auction house
2. **Sign:** Buyer signs and sends transaction
3. **Confirm:** Backend verifies and updates listing status

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ No more assertion errors
- ‚úÖ Platform receives 2.5% fee on resales
- ‚úÖ Organizers receive NO additional fees on resales (as requested)
- ‚úÖ Proper NFT ownership transfer

### 5. Database Minimization

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/events/[id]/confirm-purchase/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/marketplace/confirm-buy/route.ts`
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` (already using blockchain)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Tickets: Store only `nftMintAddress`, `eventId`, `userId`
- ‚úÖ `metadataUri` set to null (query from blockchain instead)
- ‚úÖ Profile page fetches NFTs directly from blockchain
- ‚úÖ User tickets loaded via `CandyMachineService.getUserTickets()`

**Result:**
- **Primary Source:** Solana blockchain
- **Database:** Only for search/filter indexes and event metadata
- **Reduced Redundancy:** No duplicate data between DB and chain

### 6. Frontend Updates

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/event/[id]/page.tsx` (already had prepare/confirm)
- `src/app/resale/page.tsx`

**Updates:**
- ‚úÖ Event purchase: Already using prepare/sign/confirm flow
- ‚úÖ Resale purchase: Updated to prepare/sign/confirm flow
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling for transaction failures
- ‚úÖ Transaction signatures displayed to users
- ‚úÖ Solscan links for viewing on blockchain

**Result:**
- Users sign all transactions with their wallets
- Real payments executed on Solana
- Clear transaction feedback and error messages

   - Sellers pay gas fees for listing
   - Platform does NOT subsidize gas fees

4. **Royalties:**
   - Enforced on-chain via NFT metadata
   - Platform receives 2.5% on ALL secondary sales
   - Organizers receive NO additional fees on resales (as per spec)

## üìä Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Real SOL payments working
- ‚úÖ Organizers receiving payments directly
- ‚úÖ Platform receiving 2.5% royalty
- ‚úÖ No assertion errors in marketplace
- ‚úÖ Candy Machine persistence working
- ‚úÖ Database minimized to essential data
- ‚úÖ Frontend using proper transaction signing

## üîß Critical Fix: Transaction Signing

### Issue
`WalletSendTransactionError: Unexpected error` when users tried to purchase tickets.

### Root Cause
Candy Machine mint transactions require **two signatures**:
- User wallet (for payment and receiving NFT)
- Platform wallet (as collection update authority)

Transaction was being sent with only user's signature.

### Solution: Partial Signing
1. **Backend:** Platform wallet pre-signs transaction as collection authority
2. **Frontend:** User adds their signature for payment
3. **Blockchain:** Complete transaction with both signatures executes successfully

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/solana/CandyMachineService.ts` - Added `transaction.partialSign(platformKeypair)`
- `src/app/event/[id]/page.tsx` - Changed from `sendTransaction` to `signTransaction` + `sendRawTransaction`
- `src/app/resale/page.tsx` - Changed from `sendTransaction` to `signTransaction` + `sendRawTransaction`
- `src/app/api/marketplace/prepare-buy/route.ts` - Conditional partial signing for auction house

### Result
‚úÖ Transactions now succeed with proper dual-signature pattern  
‚úÖ Platform signs as authority, user signs as payer  
‚úÖ Both primary sales and resales working correctly  
‚úÖ Using `signTransaction` + `sendRawTransaction` for full control

### Key Technical Detail
**Why manual send?** Wallet adapter's `sendTransaction` doesn't handle partially signed transactions correctly, causing "Unexpected error". Using `signTransaction` + `connection.sendRawTransaction()` gives full control over the signing and sending process.

*See `TRANSACTION_SIGNING_FIX.md` for detailed technical explanation.*
